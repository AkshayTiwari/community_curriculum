#Firefox OS Market Research

###Welcome to this very special opportunity to help FFOS with Market Research!  

The Fx OS team has embarked on many different initiatives and campaigns to bring Fx OS to market without having sufficient understanding and knowledge of the reality on the ground, due to a severe lack of local market data. This local market data is extremely difficult to obtain, let alone, update regularly if you’re not actually on the ground. 

We need to stop “flying blind” and start being much more data-driven when we think about how we market and ultimately grow Fx OS. To do this, **we need not only your help collecting data, but your very best storytelling and detective work to reveal the local community market.**

###Who are we?

We are [TODO] .  We're as invested in your success and experience participating as we are in  the outcome of market research.  You can reach us at [TODO]

###Who are you?

We're starting with a small group of people (2 -3 per region), interested in helping Mozilla understand their local market for mobile.  Starting with:

**Brazil, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Russia, Colombia**

Is this you?  Here are some qualities we think would make a great market research detective:

* **Interested in Market Research**:  There's a fantastic [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research) on the subject!
* **Analytical**:  You are logical,  notice patterns, contradictions, trends and  inconsistencies in many things, especially marketing and advertisement. Wikipedia, of course has a page on [Analytical Skill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_skill).
* **Organized**: Our web-app will make collection easy, but staying organized will be key to reporting.
* **Creative**: Market Research is like detective work, your ability to notice and communicate the small things, the overall picture, and to tell the story of your local market will be key to the project's understanding and overall strategy. 
* **Commited to regular participation** in our [top three tasks](http://google.com) .

**You will be one of the founding members of our new Market Research Impact Team!**

*[TODISCUSS]  Do you need to be approved to participate in this course?  Is there an onboaring conversation before this?  Who has that conversation if so?*
