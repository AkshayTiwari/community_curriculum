###Welcome to this very special opportunity to help FFOS with Market Research!  

The Fx OS team has embarked on many different initiatives and campaigns to bring Fx OS to market without having sufficient understanding and knowledge of the reality on the ground, due to a severe lack of local market data. This local market data is extremely difficult to obtain, let alone, update regularly if you’re not actually on the ground. 

We need to stop “flying blind” and start being much more data-driven when we think about how we market and ultimately grow Fx OS. To do this, *we need not only your help collecting data, but your very best storytelling and detective work to reveal the local community market.
