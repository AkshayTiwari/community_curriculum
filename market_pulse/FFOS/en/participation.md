We're starting with volunteers who are interested in helping Mozilla understand their local market for mobile.  The markets we'll be focusing on first are:

**Brazil, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Russia, Colombia**


###Marketpulse Impact Team

By participating in this initiative, **you will be able to join our new Market Research Impact Team**. An impact team is a group of Mozilla paid staff and volunteers with a shared set of skill-sets and interests, working together, as a team, on a specific project or initiative. This team meets regularly online, defines goals and objectives on a quarterly basis and aims to deliver increase impact on their project/initiative by continuously helping more, and more volunteers participate.
