Most critical for the short-term success of Firefox OS Market Research, and our Market Research Impact Team is the collection of local pricing for FFOS. The [Market Pulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community/] web app will make it easy to collect FFOS data for:

* Local Stores

## What data are we collecting?

#### Store Location
Using Open Street Map & your device location will record the store's location.

#### Device Type
Phone device brand (will will provide you with a list of those available)

#### Whether or not the phone is in stock
This is a verbal confirmation from store owners, can is recorded as true or false in the web app.

* Price 
The price of the device.

* Comments
A very important part of data collection are all those observations that occur to you as you record information. We will get into more detail about best practices next.
