![tags](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sale-tags1.png)

Most critical for the short-term success of Firefox OS Market Research, and our Market Research Impact Team is the collection of local pricing for FFOS. The [Market Pulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community/] web app will make it easy to collect FFOS data for:

* Web Stores
* Local Stores

## What data are we collecting?


* Monthly price collection of FFOS Device
[TODO]  Are we specfifying camera, processor, size?
* Monthly price collection of devices competing against Firefox OS devices
[TODO]  Shall we break this into those phones we know about, and those we don't?
* Monthly collection of pictures & videos of in market implementation : billboards, events, websites screenshots, promotions…
[TODO] Be clear if this will be in he first version of the web app.
* Observations


#### Example Observations

> * "Made in India Tag"
> * Celebrity Endorsements are popular for both Android and Nokia. [Here is one for Android](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKii_YzBW6E), and one for [SRK Nokia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M_kQdiLhI8).
> * In Summary India is being proliferated with various Android OEMS (Samsung,  Xuaemi, Lava, Spice, Intex, Karbonn, Micormax, Cellkon ) and Nokia.  
> * There is still a market for low cost smart phones, however It looks India’s sweet spot is going to be around $70-$100 for a decent smart phone with 4-5 star ratings. 
> Last but not least.. Really… Here is a Sandal/Shoes endorsement from a celebrity.. You got [to see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi_2e1HDjwU) to believe it.

Your research turns a foggy image of your local community into a vibrant and priceless work of art! This can be an incredibly fun and rewarding aspect of participation - stories can be revealed through words, images and even sound. 

* Consider taking images of display order

* Take note of special offers, whether a price is discounted or full.
