###Market Researchers unite! Firefox OS needs your help! 

The Firefox OS team has embarked on many different initiatives and campaigns to bring Firefox OS to market without always having sufficient understanding and knowledge of the reality on the ground, due to a lack of local market data. This local market data is extremely difficult to obtain, let alone, update regularly if you’re not actually on the ground. 

In our efforts to be much more data-driven when we think about how we market and ultimately grow Firefox OS, we are launching a global initiative to collect market data for Firefox OS, which we're calling Market Pulse. To this end, **we need not only your help collecting data, but your very best detective work to have a better understanding of your local market.**

###Who are we?

We are Mozilla's Market Research team. You can reach us at [marketpulse-team@mozilla.com](mailto:marketpulse-team@mozilla.com).
TODO: Telegram Group

###Who are you?

![Detective](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3028314931_53d4aa5fc2_z.jpg)

We're starting with a small group of people (2 -3 per market), interested in helping Mozilla understand their local market for mobile.  The markets we'll be focusing on first are:

**Brazil, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Russia, Colombia**

Is this you?  Here are some qualities we think would make a great market pulse detective:

* **Interested in Market Research**:  There's a fantastic [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research) on the subject!
* **Analytical**:  You are logical,  notice patterns, contradictions, trends and  inconsistencies in many things, especially marketing and advertisement. Wikipedia, of course has a page on [Analytical Skill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_skill).
* **Organized**: Our web-app will make collection easy, but staying organized will be key to reporting.
* **Creative**: Market Research is like detective work, your ability to notice and communicate the small things, the overall picture, and to tell the story of your local market will be key to the project's understanding and overall strategy. 
* **Commited to regular participation** in our [top three tasks](http://google.com) .

###Market Research Impact Team

By participating in this initiative, **you will be one of the founding members of our new Market Research Impact Team**. An impact team is a group of Mozilla paid staff and volunteers with a shared set of skillsets and interests, working together, as a team, on a specific project or initiative. This team meets regularly online, defines goals and objectives on a quarterly basis and aims to deliver increase impact on their project/initiative by continuously helping more volunteers participate.  

###Who can participate?

The Firefox OS Market Pulse challenge is open to anyone interested in participating.
