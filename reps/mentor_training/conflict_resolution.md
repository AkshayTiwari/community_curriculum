This is a very big topic for any community, and Mozilla Reps is no different.  Understanding how,  you as mentor,  and community leader can help diffuse situations and escalate community conflict will help our over-all goals for community health.  

We are still building our curriculum specific to Mozilla Reps, but in the meantime share some fantastic resources for discussion.  Please read the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) and review these other community resoruces on the topic:

#Discussion

Please answer these questions in the Discourse forum provided  (TODO: link to Conflict Resolution topic)

1. If you were to create a list of 'best practices' for helping people resolve minor conflicts in the community what would those be?
2. What does the conflict resolution process look like for a Rep?  For a non-Rep community member?  What needs improved for each of those?
3. What type of leadership supports healthy communities?  
4. Advice do you give yourself when you experience upset, or feel offended online?  How will you help your mentee navigate those same situations?
